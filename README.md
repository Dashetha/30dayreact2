# 🌟 30‑Day React Learning Journey

> My personal 30‑day challenge to master React.js from scratch to deployment. A structured, hands‑on roadmap where I’ll learn React step‑by‑step and build projects every day.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To become confident in React fundamentals, component architecture, hooks, routing, performance, and deployment — building a strong foundation for full‑stack development.

**Duration:** 30 Days
**Daily Routine:** 30–60 mins of theory + 2–4 hours of coding practice

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

* React (Vite setup)
* React Router DOM
* Axios (for API calls)
* Context API / Redux (state management)
* Styled Components / Tailwind CSS
* Jest + React Testing Library (testing)
* Git & GitHub
* Vercel / Netlify (deployment)
* VS Code (with ESLint + Prettier)

## 🗂️ Folder Structure (General)

```
src/
├─ components/
├─ pages/
├─ hooks/
├─ context/
├─ styles/
└─ App.jsx
```

**Why this structure?**

* `components/` → Reusable UI elements
* `pages/` → Individual views linked via Router
* `hooks/` → Custom logic extracted from components
* `context/` → Global state providers
* `styles/` → Global or module‑based styling

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

* ✅ Component renders without crashing
* ✅ Events (click, submit) trigger state updates
* ✅ API calls mocked with correct responses
* ✅ Routing tests (navigation & redirect)
* ✅ Accessibility tests (roles, labels)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

1. Build project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to Vercel or Netlify (connect GitHub repo)
3. Set `BASE_URL` or API env vars if needed
4. Test on mobile & desktop
